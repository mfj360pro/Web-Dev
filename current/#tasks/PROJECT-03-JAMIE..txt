On the photographer they don't need to see matterport links or video
I would like to be able to make done when viewing the shoot

admin->shoots
  - when viewing a shoot i get this error illegal string

portal->shoots
  - assigned to we don't need
  - when shoot is Ready i only want what the editor has made alive

portal->profile
  - needs 
      - company name
      - company address
  - i don't see a way for the logo and the profile pic

editor->shoots
  - need a way to photos and videos alive
  
With all the portals i think it would be nice to have the done ones in a different tab on the shoots page 

I would like to have a permission thing were i can say to witch VA ca see what tabs..  
  - or if i can add a Role that i can select the tabs of witch the Role can see, 
    and i can put a rule per account

Customer Portal->add shoot
  - I would like the total with and without the promo code in the total
  - its not sending

the iframe and the herf link needs to be per shoot and not per person... 
and the video we need to be able to add alot... 
and it wont just be videos so its a marking tab so anything marking goes there.. 
and if theres nothing there the client doesn't see

===============================================================================================

after the promotion part we need to work on how the shoot goes through the system.. 
- when the shoot gets summit it need to find the photographer in that zip code and 
  send it to them

photographer
- need to see everything about the shoot.
- they need to add photos to the shoot.
- they need to add private notes and public notes per shoot
- they need to be able to put done with shoot

after that it needs to go to the graphic designer
- they need to be able to download the pics from the shoots and download new pics. 
  i would like it if the old pics will stay on and when they upload the new pics it will show     that they are new pics
- they need to be able to put the mattorport link in 
  there so the client can see it and use it.. 
  theres going to be 2 links one is a link and other is going to be a iframe.. 
  so i need a spot for both of them
- need a spot for them to say that they are done.

after that it needs to go to my VA
- the VA show be able to do everything that the past people can do
- the VA can summit it to be done where the client can see everything..

===============================================================================================

Project needs to be able to upload pictures, iframe link, and a herf link. 

The photographers need to be able to add notes and so does the clients, per project. 
The photographer gui when marked as on going or done it needs to change colors.

In the status bar it should say where the job is held. 
IE: 
- When the photographer is done it will go to the designer, 
- When the designer is done it will go to final editor, 
- When the final editor is done the client will then be able to see the project.

When the photographer hits [Make it my shoot] 
client will see status of [In Progress] 
until the final editor is complete then client will see [Ready].

On the up-loaders: 

Photographers to have their own section of photos, 
Final editor(VA) to have a section for their uploaded photos. 
All on the same page with the different titles of who uploaded the photos. 

Uploaders should only be able to delete their own pictures and not any from the other departments. 

VA & up permissions should be able to make the pictures alive so the client is able to view and download, including MP4 files as well.

- Client Portal
  - on the add new shoot it as subscribe to promotions.. we don't need that.. 
  - when adding a promo code it doesn't close the window, so i want it to be 
    one code per client ..
  - so we don't need the promo codes tab, but having something that shows 
    that the promo code is still alive on the shoots page.. 
  - how about when they have a promo code alive, 
    the button that says enter promo code will be initiative and say the promo code name?? 
    and i notice that the promos don't work with the total of the price..
  - on the profile
  - (i know we haven't talked about it but it will be good to say it when its in my mind) 
  - i would love it if they can put there logo the company name and slogan, 
  - and i don't like the grid look on this one if we can make it look like a form 
    and a submit button on the bottom. I think that would look good..

- Shoots Page 
  - i would like it to be in sections one for new shoots.. 
    so ones that are not all the way done.. 
    one for done on are part where its alive and they can do whatever to it.. 
    and one for that it's archive where they don't need it anymore..  

- On the Get-a-Quote 
  - the layout i think looks better.. 
  - on the scheduling part i think all we need is when can we shoot date.

- On the work flow chart.. 
  - thats is what we need right there 
    the only thing i would change will be designer will be open to all VAs, and designers.. 
    and final editor only VAs and admin
